Description: This plugin implements javascript based on convention-based HTML.

Contents:
1 - Modal Windows
2 - Slideshow
3 - AJAX contact forms (with form validation)

1) Modal Windows
	Element: a.j-modal
	Attr:	name="filename" > loads filename.php
			href="default/url/if/noscript"
	
	Script:
	Replaces default href with new one based on the name attribute.
	Uses fancybox to load the filename.php into a modal window.
	Inits ajax contact form logic for the modal window.
	
2) Slideshow
	Element: #slideshow > .slide
	CSS: slides must have an absolute position, to overlap one another
	
	Script:
	Alternatively hide and reveal .slide elements within #slideshow
	
3) AJAX contact forms
	Element:	form#j-contact
				.j-contact-loading
				.j-contact-response	
	Attr:		form[action="ajaxController"] > should be "", and keep php form logic within the window html. This makes form inclusion elsewhere easier.
	
	INSTRUCTIONS:
	The #j-contact form action should be an absolute URL to the form.php file. All php form logic should be contained
	within this file for easy inclusion of the form in other pages, as well as providing functionality even with JS
	disabled.
	
	Script:
	Init validation Engine.
	On submit,
		Show .j-contact-loading.
		Post data to form action target.
		Show .j-response on success.
		Hide .j-contact-loading.
		Close modal window.
